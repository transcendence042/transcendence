# CRS minimal setup (ASCII only)

# The SecAction below sets the OWASP CRS paranoia level (PL).
# PL1: Default, recommended for most sites. Only blocks clear attacks.
# PL2: Stricter, blocks more suspicious patterns. May require tuning.
# PL3: Even stricter, blocks advanced/borderline cases. Higher risk of false positives.
# PL4: Maximum strictness, blocks almost anything suspicious. For high-security environments only.
# Increase the paranoia level to enhance security, but be prepared to tune rules to avoid false positives.
# Example: setvar:tx.paranoia_level=2 for PL2, setvar:tx.paranoia_level=3 for PL3, etc.
SecAction "id:900050,phase:1,pass,nolog,setvar:tx.paranoia_level=1"

# Default actions (DetectionOnly). Change 'pass'->'deny' later if you want blocking.
# SecDefaultAction "phase:1,pass,log,t:none" "phase:2,pass,log,t:none"

# Body limits
# These directives control the maximum size of request bodies that ModSecurity will process.
# - SecRequestBodyLimit: Maximum size (in bytes) for the entire request body (including file uploads).
# - SecRequestBodyNoFilesLimit: Maximum size (in bytes) for request bodies without file uploads.
# - SecRequestBodyLimitAction: Action to take when a request exceeds the above limits ('Reject' is recommended for security).
# Adjust these values based on your application's needs to prevent denial-of-service attacks via oversized requests.
